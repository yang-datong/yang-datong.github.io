"You smell terrible"Andy said to the woman.
The woman said, "I just want you to give me the boxs. It's how my daughter and i survive (生存""But it's just: trash (垃报）" Said Andy.
"One person's trash is another person's treasure" the woman said, reaching out her hand, "Can I have it?"

"if you wantit, just take it out of the trash bin by yourself," Andy replied impolitely . Then he threw the box and wallked towards his mnother's car The woman didn't say anything and took the box.

Andy told his mnother about the dirty woman. His mother said in a soft voice,"Andy, not everyone has good luck Your father left us when you were two years old. We lved a hard life. I couldn't find a job so wt had to lve on the streets: One day, I met a lady and she advised me to make toney by recycling boxes. I follwed her suggestion and our life changedl after that.."

Introduction
The first step to becoming a good cat owner is to choose the right kind of cat. It is how a cat behaves that is the most important, not what she looks like or how old she is. She is going to be your best friend. You will spend a lot of time playing together. But remember, you need to look after her every day. Not just to start with, but for all her life.
Understanding your pet
By watching your cat closely, you will learn her special way of talking, From the movement ofher taii or ears, you will see if she is happy or sad. And you will soon understand what she is saying when  she miaows.
Caring for your pet
You will only be your cats best friend if you care for her properly. You will need to make sure that she eats the right foods, always has water, and can get plenty of exercise every day. You will also have to bathe her often and spend some time training her.

Victor's project
AS patr of my history project on transport, I did some short interviews with people in my
neighborhood. My first interview was with my friend Susan's grandmother, Mrs. Sanderson.

Question 1
How did you get to school when you were young?
I walked to school With tny friends, except for fridays when we had to carry all of our things for school sports. Then we caught the bus. I enjoyed walking because we could chat on the way.I didn't like it when it was raining though, but Mum always made sure I wore my raincoat and gumboots. On the othet hand, I becare a strong walker, and I belive that's why I've been heaitay all my life.

Question2
Myparents drive me to school Why didn't you go to school by car?
You know, we were not rich enough at that time. We could not afford a car until afterl had finished school

Question3
How did you get around when yau weren't going to school?
We often went for a family trip by train Most weekends we went on picnics and I loved playing
with my cousins in the park. The trip took much longer than it would take by car today of course.

Question4
How do you get around now?
I still love walking. but I need to drive my grandchildren around, so I mainly use my Car.

		Katie's father was at the airport waiting to meet her. She was going to spend'a week with him and usually she really enjoyed their visits. But this time was different: her dad was getting married, and Katie wasn't at all sure if she liked the idea.
		On the way frot the airport to her dad's house, Katie almost kept silent. Finally, her dad asked, "Do you want to talk about it, Katie?"
		For a moment, Katie sat silently. Then she said, "I'm sorry, Dad. I just don't think I want you to get marvied "
		"I thought you liked Celia" Katie's dad said
		"I do like Celia" Katie answered, "It's not that at all. I just don't know if I want her for a stepmother-that's totally different."
		"It really is different," her dad agreed, "But I hope you'll get to like having Celia as a stepmother. She likes you a lot, you know, and I'll bet Megan will, too."
		"Who's Megan?" Katie asked She hadn't heard that name before.
		"She's Celia's daughter," her dad replied, "She is your age, actualy, so maybe you'll even have something in common."
		After dropping Katie's luggage off at her dad's house, Katie and her dad went to meet Celia and Megan at a restaurant they were going to have dinrer together. When they got to the restaurant , Celia and Megan were already there. Celia introduced Megan to Katie. At first, Katie didn't know what to say to Megan. But then, Megan said, "Mom, dont forget I have swimming practice tomorrow."
		"You like to swim?" Katie asked hopefully.
		"I love it ---- I'm on our school swimming team," Megan answered excitedly, "Do you swim ?"
		"I love to swim, too" Katie said with a smile. Maybe having Celia as a stepmother. wasn't going ta be so bad after all

	Recently, many people think it's risky to use ctedit（信用） card numbers online. However, from time to time, we all use passwords and ID numbers on the Internet. We think we are safe, but that may not be tnre! A new kind of attack is being used oy dishonest people to steal IDs and credit cardnumbers from web surfers. This new kind of attackis called phishing".

	Phishing sounds the same as the word "fishing",and it means that a thief is trying to trick people into giving away valuable information. Like real fishermen, phishers use bait (诱饵) in the form of great online deals ot services. Fot example, phishers might use false emails and websites to trick people into revealing (透露)credit card numbers, account usernames, and passwords. They imitate(模仿) well-known banks,online sellers, and credit card corapanies. Successful phishers may make as many as 5% of the people believe and gie away their personal information.
  
  It's really a big problem! Actually, tricking 5% of the online population is huge. Now more than 4.6 billion people have access (进入权) to the Internet, and 75% of those Internet users live in the wealthiest countrles on Earth. It has been reported that phishers send more than 40 bilion false messages each year.Even by tricking only 5% of the people, plishers can make a lot of money.

  Amy, 18, from California, received an email. A man told Amy that she could get a milion dollars in her account as reward if she sent a thousand dollars to him. Amy did as the man said at once. The "thief" used Amy's Social Security number to get credit cards in her name and transferred her money.
  
		How can people avoid being cheated online? Above all, hey have to learn to recogrize the email that has been sent by a phisher. Always be careful with any email with urgent (紧急的) requests for personal information. Phishers typically write upsetting or excitng but false, statements in their emails so that people wil reply right away. Never give out persoral information to phishers. And if an offer sounds too good to be true, it is.

		The Aaventures of Tom Sawyer is one of the great works by Mark Twain. The book is so interesting. Even today, it is popular among kids. Although I am in my thirties, the book remains one of my favorites. After re-reading the book recently, I have leared an important lesson from Tom Sawyer.
		In our daily lives, we are often given some boring or tiring tasks. What's in your mind when your mom tells you to clean the floor? Have you ever wanted to complain（抱怨）?I think most people have.
		Tom Sawyer, however, thought "differently" when he was given a boring task. One Saturday morning, Aunt Polly told Tom to paint the fence (篱笆）.Tom's friend Ben Rogers happened to walk past. Instead of complaining. Tom told Ben that he felt "excited" about the task. "Only one in a thousand-maybe even two thousand boys can do this!" Tom said.
		Tom's words made Ben interested in the task. He even gave Tom his apple so that he could have a chance to paint the fence. If Tom had thought about nothing but complaining, be would have had a bad day painting the fence.
		This story teaches me a valuable lesson: Complaining is useless. The next time you are given a boring or tiring task, don't complain. Unlike what happens the story of Tom Sawyet, it is unlikely that someone will come and do the work for you. However, without complaining. you'll feel better and perhaps even do a better job!

		Otters are cute water animals. These days, keeping otters as pets is getting popular. In Japan, some "otter cafes" are open for business. People can pay to play with the otters there and to take photos with them. In Inalbnesia, people go swimming with their pet otters and take funny Videos. These photos and videos posted online have interested more people to buy otters as pets.
		However, these enjoyable photos and videos hide the danage that the online trade is doing to otters. In fact, wild otters are facing many threats——they have long been hunted  for their coats, in some places, fishermen have been killing otters in order to stop them from eating fish, and now, the online pet trade has become another big problem for otters.
		In the wild, baby otters usually stay With their mothers during their first year of life. According to a report, 70% of the otters sold online are under one year old. These baby otters have been stolen from their mothers. When they are kept as pets by humans, they do not live full and natural lives.
		Otters are very social. They live in family groups of up to 15 in the wild. Keeping an otter as a pet can make it very sad and lonely. These animals also need enough space to swim. Their owners'bathtubs or pools are nowhere near as large as the bodies of water in the wild.
		On the other hand, otters simply don't make good pets. They have a very special fishy smelt. If they are kept indoors, they will leave a lot of waste around the house. This would make the smell even more unpleasant. Besides,when otters are unhappy, they will make loud noises and even attack people. If a person is hurt by an otter, he or she needs to so to hospital at once.
		So, we should stop the Otter pet trade and never share photos and videos about them online.

		The human population on Earth grows larger each year. As a result, more and more food needs to be grown in order to feed everyone. Because of climate change, growing more food is becoming even more difficult.
		When farmers tried to grow more food in the past, they would use farming methods that weren' t always healthy for the environment. To solve this problem,some scientists carried out a research project They spent several years talking to farmers. They wanted to see what problems farmers were having and how these problerms could be solved. This led to the creation of special robots These special robots move around on farms and collect information about crops（庄稼）．They can take pictures of plants, track each plant's growth and measure its size.
		In the past, though farmers did bave information about the weather and the earth, they couldn't track each plant. But now, with these robots, they can
		By collecting information about plants, the robots can help farmers make predictions about how their plants will grow.  By studying each plant, the robots can also help farmers grow plants well For example, if the robots find out which plants get sick, Farmers can quickiy throw them away before they are about to influence nearby plants.

Dear Wang.
		Great to hear you are coming to the USA!  I do hope you can stop by and visit us in the Big Apple— a popular name for New York City. There are so many things to see and do here. It would take a lifetime to list thema all: Chinatowm, Wall Street, Centrat Park, to name only a few. But knowing you as I do, I'd suggest walking through Midtown Manhattan. It is very popular in the USA and just can't be missed!
		People often say that no visit to New York City is complete without a trip to Broadway!
Broadway with its cafes, street performcus(表演者) and colorful signs really represents New York's loud spirit! As Broadway is the heart of tlhe American theater industry, it's at night when it truly comes alive. Broadway is well-known for its big theaters. They show Shakespeare, modern plays, dance shows or musicals — take your pick! With your love of singing and interest in drama(戏剧),Idrecommed（推荐）amusical. It's a great and moving experience that I'm sure you would love — a bit like Peking opera! Many musicals are based on classic stories like Les Miserables or Perer Pan, and they might even inspire（激发）you read the books, too!
		My big news is that am going to China on vacation this winter. I am looking for places of interest in China. Can you recommend some to me?
See you soon!																																					Leslie

		I went to Beijing to study Chinese last year. I was excited about all the chances to better my language skills, walk on the Great wall, and most of all, eat real Chinese food! I still remember my first jianbing. jiaozi and Pekine duck. Each of them was amazing in its own way.
		I konw that real Chimese food would be different from the Chinese food had eaten in the USA. I couldn't wait to try all the mouth-watering dishes that came up in my research about Chinese food. One of my favorites turned out to be hotpot （火锅） 
		My first-ever hotpot experience in Old Bejing was unforgettable . AS a first-timer, I was moved by the waiters'friendliness and their warmth of welcome. They tried their best to introduce all of the oils and spices(调味香料） to me.
		Looking around, I found that everyone had their own favorite sauce combinations ,ingredents and styles,Some would carefuliy put their ingredieats into the hotpot one after another. Others would impatiently put whole plates into the bubbling oil. you can learn a lot from the way people eat hotpot.
		When I went back to the USA,I decided prepare a hotpot meal for my family. It allowed me to not only share the cuture that I had learned about, but also offer others a chance to experience China like I had. It's amazing that hotpot could bring so much to life!

		几千年来，语言一直在来来去去，但在最近，出现的语言越来越少，消失的语言越来越多。当世界上还居住着狩猎-采集者的时候，小的，紧密相连的(联系)群体形成了自己独立于彼此的说话模式。一些语言专家认为，10,000年前，当世界上只有500到1,000万人时，他们之间可能会说12,000种语言。
		不久之后，这些人中的许多人开始定居下来成为农民，他们的语言也变得更加稳定，数量也越来越少。近几个世纪以来，贸易、工业化、民族国家的发展和普遍义务教育的普及，特别是过去几十年的全球化和更好的沟通，都导致了许多语言的消失，英语、西班牙语和汉语等主导语言正日益取代。
		目前，世界上大约有6800种语言。这些语言的分布非常不均匀。一般来说，温和地区的语言相对较少，经常有很多人说，而炎热潮湿的地区有很多语言，通常是少数人说的。欧洲只有大约200种语言；美洲大约有1000种；非洲2400种；亚洲和太平洋地区可能有3200种，其中仅巴布亚新几内亚一国就超过800种。说话者的中位数(中位数)只有6,000人，这意味着世界上一半的语言使用的人少于6,000人。
		在总共6,800种语言中，已经有400多种语言濒临灭绝(消亡)，只剩下几个说老年语言的人。随机挑选喀麦隆的布苏(剩下的八个发言者)、墨西哥的恰帕内科(150个)、美国的利潘·阿帕奇(两三个)或澳大利亚的瓦吉古(一个，带问号)：这些似乎都没有太大的生存机会。

		我们可能认为我们的文化是一看到闪亮和新的东西就抛弃旧技术的文化，但一项新的研究表明，在旧设备(装置)过时后，我们仍然会继续使用它们。这对环境和我们的钱包来说是个坏消息，因为这些过时的设备比做同样事情的新设备消耗的能量要多得多。
		为了弄清楚这些设备消耗了多少电力，纽约罗切斯特理工学院的凯莉·巴比特和她的同事们跟踪了每种产品在整个生命周期内的环境成本--从开采矿物到我们停止使用设备的时间。这种方法提供了自20世纪90年代初以来家庭能源使用情况的读数。设备是按世代划分的。1992年定义的台式电脑、基本移动电话和盒式电视机。数码相机于1997年问世。MP3播放器、智能手机和液晶电视在2002年进入家庭，2007年平板电脑和电子阅读器出现之前。
		然而，随着我们积累了更多的设备，我们并没有扔掉旧的。一位研究人员说：“起居室的电视被换掉了，放在孩子们的房间里，突然有一天，房子里的每个房间都有一台电视。”电子设备的平均数量从1992年的每户4台增加到2007年的13台。我们不仅保留了这些旧设备，我们还在继续使用它们。根据巴比特团队的分析，旧的台式显示器和带有阴极射线管的盒式电视是最糟糕的设备，它们的能源消耗和对温室气体排放(排放)的贡献在1992年至2007年期间翻了一番以上。
		那么解决方案是什么(解决方案)？该团队的数据截止到2007年，但研究人员还探索了如果消费者用具有多种功能的新电子产品取代旧产品会发生什么，比如用于文字处理和电视观看的平板电脑。他们发现，在平板电脑上更多地按需观看娱乐节目，而不是在电视和台式电脑上观看，可以节省44%的能源消耗。

		Color is fundamental in home design——something you’ll always have in every room. A grasp of how to manage color in your spaces is one of the first steps to creating rooms you’ll love to live in. Do you want a room that’s full of life? Professional? Or are you just looking for a place to relax after a long day? Whatever you’re looking for , color is the key to making a room feel the way you want it to feel.
		Over the years, there have been a number of different techniques to help designers approach this important point. While all of them are useful , they can get a little complex. But good news is that there’re really only three kinds of decisions you need to make about color in your home: the small ones, the medium ones, and the large ones.
		Small color choices are the ones we’re most familiar with They’re the little spots of color like throw pillows ,mirrors and baskets that most of us use to add visual interest to our rooms   . Less tiring than painting your walls and less expensive than buying a colorful sofa ,small color choices bring with them the significant benefit of being easily changeable .
		Medium color choices are generally furniture pieces such as sofas, dinner tables or bookshelves Color choices in this range are a step up from the small ones in two major ways . They require a bigger commitment than smaller ones, and they have a more powerful effect on the feeling of a space.
		The large color decisions in your rooms concern the walls, ceilings, and floors . Whether you’re looking at wallpaper or paint, the time, effort and relative expense put into it are significant. So it pays to be sure, because you want to get it right the first time .
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		色彩是家居设计的基础--这是你在每个房间里都会有的东西。掌握如何管理空间中的颜色是创造你喜欢居住的房间的第一步之一。你想要一个充满活力的房间吗？专业的？或者你只是想在漫长的一天后找个地方放松一下？无论你在寻找什么，颜色是让房间感觉到你想要的感觉的关键。
		多年来，有许多不同的技术来帮助设计师接近这一重要的点。虽然它们都很有用，但它们可能会变得有点复杂。但好消息是，关于家里的颜色，你真的只需要做三种决定：小的、中等的和大的。
		小的颜色选择是我们最熟悉的，它们是我们大多数人用来增加房间视觉趣味的小色点，比如抱枕、镜子和篮子。不像粉刷墙壁那么累，比买一张五颜六色的沙发更便宜，小的颜色选择带来了容易改变的显著好处。
		中等颜色的选择通常是家具，如沙发、餐桌或书架。这一系列的颜色选择在两个主要方面比小的选择要高一步。与较小的承诺相比，它们需要更大的承诺，而且它们对空间的感觉有更强大的影响。
		你房间里的大颜色决定与墙壁、天花板和地板有关。无论你是在看墙纸还是油漆，投入的时间、精力和相关费用都是相当可观的。所以肯定是值得的，因为你想在第一次就把它弄对。

		During my second year at the city college，I was told that the education department was offering a "free"course, called Thinking Chess, for three credits. I jumped at the idea of taking the class because, after all ,who doesn't want to save a few dollars? More than that, I'd always wanted to learn chess. And,even if I weren’t excited enough about free credits,news about our instructor was appealing enough to me. He was an international grandmaster, which meant I would be learning from one of the game's best .I could hardly wait to meet him.
		Maurice Ashley was kind and smart, a former graduate returning to teach, and this job was no game for him: he meant business. In his introduction, he made it clear that our credits would be hard-earned. In order to pass the class ,among other criteria, we had to write a paper on how we plan to apply what we would learn in class to our future professions and, eventually to our lives. I managed to get an A in that course and learned life lessons that have served me well beyond the classroom .
		Ten years after my chess class with Ashley, I'm still putting to use what he taught me:“The absolute most important skill that you learn when you play chess is how to make good decisions .On every single move you have to analyze a situation ,process what your opponent(对手)is doing and evaluate the best move from among all your options.”These words still ring true today in my role as a journalist.
